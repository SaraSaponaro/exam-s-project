# Exam project
A segmentation algorithm for mass lesions in mammography.

# Dataset info
The dataset composed of 177 images is in the folder named "large_sample".
The dataset of reference segmented masses is the folder named "large_sample_Im_segmented_ref".
the dataset of our segmented masses is the folder named "result".

# Programs info
To perform the segmentation run the program "segmentation.py".
To extract the features run the program "feature.py".
Machine learning implementation is written in file "DNN.ipynb" which is linked to Colab.
